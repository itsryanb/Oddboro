// What a colleague sees through a thread is no wider than its own access,
// unless the owner says yes: a hand-off never waits on the office, and is told
// which tools others on the work have that the colleague lacks. A giver whose
// work needs their contents raises a plain ask first, and the owner's answer
// reaches it as any ask's does. Access is compared with every Odd on the
// thread, both ways: what the colleague lacks, and what it has that others
// lack. Tools are outside tools, the web, and the folders the owner gave. The
// office's own code on every migration, in an in-memory PGlite that stands in
// for db.ts (pglite.ts). Run with `npm test -w @oddboro/ledger`.
