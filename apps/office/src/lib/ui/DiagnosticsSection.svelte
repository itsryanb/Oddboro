    When something breaks, Oddboro can send New Altitude a report: what failed, where in the code,
    and how long it took.
    {#if diagnostics.account}
      Reports go with your New Altitude sign-in: New Altitude checks it, then passes the report on
      without it, so Sentry never learns your account.
    {/if}
    Never your chats, files, Odds' work, family details or name. Error text only in fixed forms, never
    your words. Sentry stores reports with your city and country, never your IP address.
