    {
      q: 'What is an Odd?',
      a: 'An AI worker in your office. Each Odd runs on Claude Code, Codex or Grok, with one job description, a place on the floor, and the tools you connected for it.'
    },
    {
      q: 'What does it cost?',
      a: 'Oddboro itself is free under Apache 2.0. The AI your Odds run on costs what it already costs you, on your own plan or API key.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Which AI account do I need?',
      a: 'One of these: a Claude plan that signs in to Claude Code, or an Anthropic API key; the ChatGPT account you use with Codex; or your Grok account. You pick one for the office, and can run any Odd on another.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Does it run on Windows or Linux?',
      a: 'Yes, both. Windows: an installer for Windows 10 and 11, on x64 and arm64. Linux: an AppImage for x86_64 and arm64, on a desktop with systemd, a keyring and notifications.'
    },
    {
      q: 'What leaves my computer?',
      a: 'Only what the work needs. Odds send their work to the AI they run on, under your own account, and an Odd talks to the tools you connected for it. The app checks GitHub for new versions of itself. Your sign-in goes to New Altitude only if you sign in to a New Altitude account, and error reports only if you are signed in and turn them on.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Can an Odd act without asking me?',
      a: 'Yes, within the limits you set. At the act level an Odd does housekeeping inside the office on its own, and uses any tool you gave it write access to. At draft, each change it wants to make in a tool waits on your desk for your yes, and so does everything else.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I pick the model?',
      a: 'Yes, for each Odd. Pick Claude Code, Codex or Grok, then a model from its list and how hard it thinks.'
    },
    {
      q: 'What is the Office Manager?',
      a: 'Your first Odd. It runs the floor, puts your daily report on your desk at 7 each morning, and helps you hire the rest. Pick one of the four ready-made managers, or describe your own.'
    },
    {
      q: 'How do I start over, or remove it?',
      a: 'On a Mac, turn off Open at login in the menu bar, quit Oddboro, and move it to the Trash. On Windows, turn off Open at login in the tray, quit Oddboro, and uninstall it in Settings, Apps. On Linux, turn off Open at login in the tray (or delete `~/.config/autostart/Oddboro.desktop`), quit Oddboro, and delete the AppImage. Every way, your office stays in the `.oddboro` folder in your home folder until you delete it. From source, `npm run reset` starts the office over: it moves the old one into `~/.oddboro/backups/` and deletes nothing. To remove a source install, run `npm run service:uninstall -w apps/office`, then delete the folder.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Who makes it?',
      a: 'New Altitude, Inc. The code is open, but the license grants no rights to the Oddboro name.'
    }
